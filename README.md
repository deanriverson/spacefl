# SpaceFL
A simple tiny space game [originally written in JavaFX][1] by [Gerrit Grunwald (a.k.a hansolo_)][2]
and ported to Flutter and Dart.

Gerrit is welcoming donations at [Paypal](https://paypal.me/hans0l0)

### Overview
All Flutter source code is in the `lib` directory. Platform-specifc build files and source code lives in the `ios`, `android`, and `web` directories.
